# SINoCOLO

SINoALICE bot for GvG colo fights and farming stuff.

Limitations:
* colo logic is rearguard only, vanguard characters won't detect weapon types correctly
* colo targeting is preset based, was too lazy to make proper AI
* Bluestacks emulator only (easy to add others if you know c# )

Features:
* purify and use bursts
* farming: complete story chapter, farm stage (on repeat), farm event (same, just X number of times)
* auto resume fights if game decides to disconnect
* colo: 
  * aware of demon/shinma summoning, prioritize weapon types for it
  * aware of elemental boosts, prioritize weapons
  * auto pause clicking when detected opened chat or NM summon selection
  * purify and manage bursts to avoid wasting them
  
Pretty much just fire and forget, unless game gets stuck.
